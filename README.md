# dinosaur-runner

T-rex Runner game implemented using JavaScript language.  
The player must avoid the moving objects (cactuses) by making the dino jump over them and get a higher score.
The game's best score will be stored using `localStorage` window object property, giving the option to reset it at the end of each loss.  

Some `setInterval` functions have been replaced by `requestAnimationFrame` to improve performance and smoothness of the movement in the browser.

• Press "Space" key to Jump.  

• Cactus speed increases for every 100 points.
